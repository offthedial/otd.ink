First, this is how the balancing system works. Since most of our players have X rank, you will be placed up with X rank players in your team; since teams are balanced, you're not balanced to be similar ranks within the team. However, if we get to the point where we can have multiple brackets, this issue will be reduced. Second, in my opinion, 1v1 practice is a horrible way to practice in the 48 hours you have to practice in this tournament. 1v1 practice is better when you're in your teams with relatively similar skill levels and plan to stay in a team longer than 48 hours. My recommendation would be to either do scrims, league or sendouq. This is because working together in a team using call-outs and understanding how each other play is much more helpful than improving your skill level (which is where 1v1 practice mainly benefits from). I went on a tangent there, but I hope that covers that!"),"\n"),"\n",r.createElement(t.p,null,r.createElement(t.em,null,"3 rank X players and an average B rank player is not as balanced as a mix of X ranks and S+ ranks.")),"\n",r.createElement(t.blockquote,null,"\n",r.createElement(t.p,null,"On the surface, I agree by looking at the results screen, but there's a lot more in it.
