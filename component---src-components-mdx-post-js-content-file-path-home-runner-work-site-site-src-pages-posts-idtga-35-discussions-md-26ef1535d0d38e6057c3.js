We balance using a collective of ranks, competitive experience, play style and timezones. Ranks are converted into a numerical value, and this provides what we call the initial "elo". From here, we then take a look at your competive experience and depending on how much you have, we will give more points to your "elo" score. For example, if an A- player had won an event such as Superjump, we would likely give them around 1500 bonus points to add into their "elo" score. Once the elo has been properly calibrated for each individual player, the brackets are them formed and initial teams are created. From here, we drag and drop players manually into we feel like there is an even disburution of play style across the bracket (note that it is within the bracket, so if there are 43 frontline players and 1 backline players, there will be only one team with a backline). Finally, we look at the timezones, group them slightly, and make sure that there are no more than two grouped timezones on a team - because it is impossible to have every team be in the one timezone group AND have teams balanced.'),"\n",l.createElement(t.p,null,"There are few flaws with this system however.
