To give context to those who weren't in the scenario, there was a dropout on a team, and the round progressed as a 3v4 - which is normal. But unfortunately, our streamer incorrectly assembled the teams, which you would then assume that a team would do a quick KO to end the match. However, both teams played out the game. Following this, a sub was found, who took some time to get them into the lobby. At this point, I decided that this was taking too long since there was only so much time allocated in the round. I decided to award the first game to the team that did not have the DC and communicated to the streamer to skip the first match. However, to top this all off, this was also when the start.gg issues were beginning to occur, so on top of this issue, every other ongoing match was having problems as they could not connect to the bracket platform. This led to a delay in me communicating with the streamer to skip the first match and move on to the second map. Since one team believed this was an error and not meant to occur, you would expect them to allow the other team to KO for a quick restart to fix the issue. But instead, both teams ended up playing, and because of time constraints, the game's result was final."),"\n",o.createElement(t.p,null,"Essentially what allowed this to happen was errors on every front.
